                <p>In collaboration with Pininfarina, a renowned high design brand, I had the unique opportunity to bring their digital project to life through a sophisticated and user-centric online shop. 
                  The primary goal of this project was to create a simple yet elegant online shopping experience that would direct all attention to the exceptional quality of Pininfarina's products.

                <p>The goal was to create a simple but elegant online shop that focused all attention on the quality of the products. 
                Through a successful collaboration with the Pininfarina's Design Studio, we launched a successful shop from day one, reaching sales as far as the USA.</p>
